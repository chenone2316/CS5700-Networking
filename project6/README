+Task 1: What are your apps doing with the network?+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Highlevel Approach:
In this task, I have to count the apps that i used every day. I try to filter DNS information from traffic tcpdump trace files. I will keep recording
the domain names requested from my iphone and determine the org name by parsing the domain names. For example, if there is a parsed record: 
uu.qq.com, i will assume qq app has contacted with the uu.qq.com request. Then, I will try to record ten apps or orgs that i used at the most time, and 
count the times of contacted sites. But this method has a weaknesses. Sometimes, many apps will be developed by the same company. Like, Tencent has apps
like qq, wechat and qq news. They all send a dns request which ends with "qq.com". However, it should be corresponded to qq.com, wechat.qq.com and news.qq.com.
We can not determine the accurate app on our phone by looking through "qq.com" only.

Question 1: How many sites are contacted by each app that you use?
ANS: I developed a program called count_app.py to count the how many site are contacted by each app in my iphone. The statistic data is as follow.
I used the data on 18th April, 2015.

google: 715
amazon: 3
apple: 1317
qq, wechat, news: 52
163 net: 2
netease: 6
yahoo: 2
linkedin: 0
itunes: 18
icloud: 56


Question 2: Does that traffic seem legitimate?
I do not see any legitimate traffic. I deem that it is because I have not used many apps on that day, so the I do not encounter the exceptional traffic.

Question 3: Is there anything surprising in your data?
There are no anything surprising thing in my data. It is okay and normal.

+Task 2: Identify PII+
++++++++++++++++++++++

I have tried to modify the grepForStuff.sh file by adding some personal information, like my qq username, my password, my account and my IMEI. And when I test 
the data on 14th April, 2015. I found most of the PII is leaked from qq username mostly. Here is an example.

App Name: QQ
 
PII Type: user name/user id

The wired thing is that, I found the PII leak from credit. But it does not match with my creid card number or debit card number. The instance is below.It think 
it is because the number below is some random combination from traffic, but they just match the regular expression in the credit card number pii check part.
